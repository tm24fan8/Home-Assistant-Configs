# Tony's Home Assistant Configs

Just a place to track my work on my personal Home Assistant configuration, and learn as I go. Maybe also TRY to keep myself a little bit more organized ;)

## New location for Node-RED flows

I have recently started using the Node-RED Projects feature, which makes version control for my flows a LOT easier than it was before.

With this change, the Node-RED flows are now in a new repo used as a submodule to this repo. They can be found at [HA-NerdFlows](https://github.com/tm24fan8/HA-NerdFlows).

## Attributions

I am fairly new to this, and while I'm learning to do a lot of it myself, I have definitely pulled ideas (in most cases modifying them for my needs) from other sources as well. Some of the most noteworthy are below.

- [SlackerLabs](https://github.com/thejeffreystone/homeassistant-config) - This guy has a lot of EXCELLENT videos on [his YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/SlackerLabs) and is very good at explaining things in a way that someone new to all of this can understand. *His old repo where I got a lot of my ideas is [here](https://github.com/thejeffreystone/home-assistant-configuration).*
- [Everything Smart Home](https://www.youtube.com/c/EverythingSmartHome) - I haven't used much code from him, because to my knowledge he doesn't publish it anywhere. But his videos ARE very informative and well-made, and I have learned a lot from watching them. Many ideas have been gained from this channel.
