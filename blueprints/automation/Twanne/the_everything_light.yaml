  description: "**Version 2.5**\nThe Everything Light: select any trigger and turn
    on your light in multiple ways:\n  - just turn the light on in it's default state\n
    \ - turn it on with a set brightness, color and/or temperature value\n  - turn
    it on dynamically with a brightness value that changes according to an ambient
    light sensor\n\nThe blueprint also allows you to turn the light off again in 3
    ways:\n  - at a set time\n  - with 1 or more triggers\n  - with a staircase function
    (turn off the light after a set time has passed)\n\n  Conditions can be set to
    prevent both turn on and turn off functions.\n\n**The dynamic lighting logic is
    based of the Smart Lux Dimmer Blueprint:**\n  - [Find it on the Home Assistant
    Community forums:](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/smart-lux-dimmer-adjust-light-brightness-depending-on-light-sensor-value/403646)\n

        - **DEFAULT MODE:**

        The light will turn on at it''s default setting.


        - **TOGGLE MODE:**

        Toggle the light.


        - **FIXED MODE: **

        The light will turn on at a set brightness percentage, optionally color or
        temperature can be set.


        - **DYNAMIC MODE**

        The light will be assigned a brightness value based on the value of a ambient
        light sensor, optionally color or temperature can be set.
